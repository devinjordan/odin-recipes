    <li>Bring a pot of water, salted to taste, to a boil. Add the dry pasta and boil until al dente per the instructions on the box.</li>

    <li>In a pot, melt the butter and add the flour. Stir on medium heat until the roux is a golden brown.</li>

    <li>Add the al dente macaroni. Stir to coat.</li>
    <li>Pour half the macaroni into a cast iron skillet. Top with one cup of sharp shredded cheddar cheese. Pour the rest of the macaroni and top with the remaining cheese. Add the buffalo chicken on top, distributed evenly.</li>
    <li>Put the dish in the oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, until the chicken has become slightly crisp.</li>
