  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This recipe is a classic! The sauce is rustic and creamy, with a warmth to it (thanks to the vodka!). It pairs very well with sliced or ground italian sausage to give it some extra protein. You'll likely want to use a round variety of pasta (think rotini or penne).</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 lb. Penne or Rotini Pasta</li>
    <li>20 oz. Can of peeled tomatoes (San Marzano preferred)</li>
    <li>Italian Seasaonings (Oregano, Sage, Rosemary, Basil, Thyme, Red Pepper Flakes)</li>
    <li>1/2 to 3/4 lbs. Italian Sausage (sliced or ground)</li>
    <li>Garlic Toast (Optional)</li>
    <li>Parmesan (Parmigiano Reggiano preferred)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. The water should be salted to taste. Follow the instructions on the box to cook the pasta.</li>
    <li>Cook the italian sausage in a pan with 1 tbsp. of olive oil. Set aside for later.</li>
    <li>In a large saucepan, combine the peeled tomatoes, tomato paste (if desired), and seasonings to taste. When the sauce has reduced by 1/4, add the italian sausage (if ground) to make a meaty sauce.</li>
    <li>When the pasta is cooked to desired doneness, plate and top with sauce. Garnish with grated parmesan and fresh ground pepper.</li>
  </ol>
