  <p>The perfect combination of sweet, savory, and sour. This dish checks all the boxes. The perfect sear on your pork, alongside tender, yet crunchy vegetables is something worth drooling over.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pork Chops, Bone-In (Pork tenderloin is a fine substitution)</li>
    <li>Onion, Sweet or Yellow</li>
    <li>Red, Yellow, Green Bell Peppers</li>
    <li>Fresh Basil</li>
    <li>Red Wine Vinegar</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <li>Utilize whatever preferred method you'd like for cooking the pork. I prefer either stove-top sear with a finish in the oven, or sous vide with a sear to finish.</li>
    <li>Slice the onion and peppers into long, thin strips. Place them into a bowl and coat with salt. Do not rinse them as this will ruin the sautee.</li>
    <li>Sautee the peppers and onions in a large skillet, pre-warmed with 1 tbsp. of olive oil and a spoonful of sugar.</li>
    <li>Add the red wine vinegar, fresh basil, and another tbsp of olive oil. Allow this to stew until the onions and peppers are tender, then remove from heat.</li>
    <li>Plate this with your pork chop(s) and enjoy!</li>
